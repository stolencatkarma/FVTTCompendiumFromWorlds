# FVTTCompendiumFromWorlds

this creates a module from worlds and iterates it into a compendium.

put the .py file in /Data/ directory and run it with python3 FvTTCompendiumFromWorlds.py

this program looks for anything and everything from your worlds and puts them into a compendium and creates a module from the data it finds.

before running the program please close FoundryVTT

after running the program check to make sure the module "AutoGenerated" was added to your modules (it may take longer to load)

enter a dnd5e game and enable the module. 

the window should refresh and you should now have access to everything from your worlds.
